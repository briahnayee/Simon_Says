# Simon Says Game
#### A project by Briahna Yee for General Assembly's SEI Fundamentals course

## Description
This is a memory game where the user must remember and repeat the pattern that the Simon game displays. Each level adds another element of the pattern to remember. 

## Technologies Used
This Simon Says game uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started
Game link: https://briahnayee.github.io/Simon_Says/

To start the game, press the 'start' button. A pattern will light up. The first pattern will be only one color. After the Simon Game finishes the pattern, click the buttons to repeat the pattern. If you have inputted the correct pattern, the game will move on to the next round. Each round adds one more color to the end of the pre-existing pattern. At any time, hit the 'reset' button to start over. If the you input the wrong pattern, the game will end and reset.

## Next Steps
In the future, I would like to add sound and a level counter. It would be cool to have difficulty settings as well that change how quickly the Simon game gives you a pattern and a level option where it adds two colors per round instead of just one.
